WebLinuxOS is a fully interactive Linux-like desktop environment that lives entirely
inside your browser. It ships with a window manager, a virtual filesystem, a real
shell with 160+ commands, and 200+ application launchers covering developer tools,
media, productivity, learning, and creative work.

All state is persisted in `localStorage`. No backend. No tracking. No build step
required to use it — just open the URL.

## Highlights

- **Real window manager** — drag, resize, minimize, maximize, multi-monitor-style tiling
- **Real terminal** — pipe, redirect, scripting, history, autocomplete, color escape codes
- **200+ applications** — file manager, code editor (Monaco), IDE, image viewer, video player, music studio, drawing app, 3D viewer
- **Live public API integrations** — GitHub trending, Hacker News, Open-Meteo, CoinGecko, NASA APOD, Wikipedia, IP geolocation, and more
- **Customizable desktop** — wallpapers, themes, grid layouts, app dock, lock screen
- **Keyboard-first** — every action has a shortcut, terminal shortcuts follow `readline` conventions
- **Internationalization ready** — UI strings are centralized for future i18n

### State Model

- `store.tsx` is the single source of truth for window z-order, focus, geometry,
  user theme, lock state, and app preferences.
- The virtual filesystem (`store/fileUtils.ts`) is a hierarchical JSON tree
  backed by `localStorage`, with a permission system that gates `sudo` and
  ownership checks.
- Each window is rendered lazily through `React.lazy` to keep the initial
  bundle small — opening a heavy app (e.g. the IDE) does not block startup.

### Terminal

The terminal is a real shell interpreter (not a string matcher). It supports:

- 160+ built-in commands (`ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `curl`, `git`, `node`, `python`, `npm`, `docker`, …)
- Pipes (`|`), redirects (`>`, `>>`, `<`), chaining (`;`, `&&`, `||`)
- Background processes (`&`), `jobs`, `kill`
- Tab completion, history (`↑`/`↓`), reverse search (`Ctrl+R`)
- Variable expansion (`$HOME`, `$PATH`)
- Aliases, `export`, `source`, function definitions
- Sandboxed `node` / `python` runners using web workers (subset of stdlib)

## Public API Integrations

All API integrations use key-less public endpoints wherever possible, so the
project runs on GitHub Pages without any environment configuration. Services
that require keys (OpenWeatherMap, NewsAPI, ExchangeRate) read from
`VITE_*` environment variables and fall back to a `demo_key` placeholder.

## Deployment

WebLinuxOS is a pure SPA. The build outputs to `web-linux/dist/`.

### GitHub Pages (automated)

1. Ensure your default branch is `main` and GitHub Pages is configured to serve
   from the `gh-pages` branch (or the `/` root of `main`).
2. The project includes a workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that
   builds and deploys on every push to `main`.
3. Visit `https://<username>.github.io/WebLinuxOS/`.

### Static hosting

Upload the contents of `web-linux/dist/` to any static host (Netlify, Vercel,
Cloudflare Pages, S3, nginx). No server-side configuration is required.

### Environment Variables (optional)

Create `web-linux/.env` to override API keys:

```ini
VITE_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_NEWSAPI_KEY=your_key
VITE_EXCHANGERATE_API_KEY=your_key
VITE_NASA_API_KEY=your_key
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue first to discuss substantial
changes — for typo fixes and small improvements, feel free to send a PR directly.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Make your changes
4. Run `npm run typecheck && npm run build` to verify
5. Open a pull request

When adding a new app:

- Add a new file under `web-linux/src/apps/`
- Register it in `web-linux/src/apps.tsx` with a stable `id`, an icon, a category
  (`system`, `development`, `utilities`, `office`, `creative`, `media`, `fun`,
  `knowledge`, `finance`, `security`)
- Register the lazy import in `web-linux/src/components/desktop/WindowManager.tsx`
- Keep the component self-contained; do not import global CSS variables from
  outside the theme tokens

When adding a new terminal command:

- Add the implementation under `web-linux/src/apps/terminal/`
- Register the command in the command dispatcher
- Update the help output in `commands/help.ts`
